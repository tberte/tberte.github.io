# Clinical Psychology
Since 2016, I have worked as a clinical psychologist, specializing in the assessment and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders and youth anxiety. My work integrates evidence-based approaches to provide tailored interventions that support the unique needs of children and adolescents, helping them navigate developmental challenges and manage anxiety effectively.

# Data Science
As a freelance data scientist and statistician, I apply my expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and predictive analytics across various domains. My work involves transforming raw data into actionable insights, using both advanced statistical techniques and machine learning to solve complex problems and support decision-making processes.
