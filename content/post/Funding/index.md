# Funding
I have successfully secured funding for multiple high-impact projects. In 2024, I obtained funding for a Ph.D. student conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) focused on anxiety treatment. This study aimed to explore effective interventions for reducing anxiety in clinical populations, contributing valuable evidence to the field.

Additionally, I secured funding for a large-scale project that implemented cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in 70 schools, aimed at addressing mental health challenges in school-aged children. This project involved training health professionals, delivering interventions, and collecting data to evaluate the program’s efficacy, with the goal of scaling up mental health support across educational settings.
