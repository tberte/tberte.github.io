# Research

## Experience:
I have extensive experience in project planning, overseeing all stages from initial design to execution, ensuring alignment with project goals and timelines. My work in data collection includes both qualitative and quantitative approaches, carefully designed to capture high-quality and meaningful data. I am proficient in academic writing with multiple projects resulting in reports, peer-reviewed publications, and contributions to grant applications. My experience in grant-writing has involved drafting proposals, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, and securing funding for research initiatives. My statistical competence includes a wide range of methods, allowing me to effectively analyze and interpret complex datasets.

## Findings:
Throughout my projects, I have consistently generated findings that have advanced the understanding of key research areas. These findings often highlight novel insights and practical applications, helping shape recommendations for both academic and practical communities.

## Methods used:
I have applied various Bayesian methods to improve parameter estimation and model uncertainty. My expertise includes structural equation modeling (SEM) for understanding complex relationships between variables, and frequentist approaches for hypothesis testing and estimation. Additionally, I have worked with network analysis to explore relational data, and growth-curve modeling to examine changes over time within longitudinal datasets.

## Interests:
I am particularly interested in methodological innovations that bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications. My areas of focus include improving the efficacy of interventions through advanced modeling techniques and refining statistical methods to provide clearer interpretations of psychological and behavioral data.
